Project Specification <br />
This is my React application for SoftUni course - ReactJS for a travel experience sharing. The application has locations which a unregistered user can browse but can't interact with in any other way - can't like the location and can't comment. <br />
The application has a profile for each user where they can browse through the locations they have liked and the ones they have created. The user has the ability to delete or edit ONLY the locations they have created.<br />
A registered user can like any location that isn't created by them and can comment on any location. Any user can delete their own comments. Users cannot like locations twice. By liking a location it is addded to the user's profile where they can review all of their liked locations.<br />
